# This is for deploying to the "official" service that runs the API and frontend screeners.
# In order to use it, you'll need to have the key file referenced below in your home directory
# and be allowed to act as the cloud-run-developer service account.

# If you intend to run your own instance of the toolkit, then you'll need to setup your own
# deployment pipeline in Google Cloud or elsewhere. (You won't be able to use this script as is)
