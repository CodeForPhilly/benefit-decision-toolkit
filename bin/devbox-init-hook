# This is an example of a custom devbox init hook.
# It is for commands you want to run every time you enter the devbox shell.
# For example, you might want to disable tools like mise, nodenv, etc.
# (Since these might interfere with the devbox environment)

# IMPORTANT: don't use this script for environment variables; use .env instead.

# e.g. disable mise in devbox shell
command -v mise >/dev/null && mise --quiet deactivate || true
