# Introduction

## 1. What Is the Benefit Decision Toolkit?

The **Benefit Decision Toolkit (BDT)** is a low-code platform for building and publishing custom benefit eligibility screeners to the web.

Using BDT, organizations can quickly create screeners that help individuals determine whether they may qualify for specific benefits. The platform is designed to be simple, flexible, and accessible, enabling teams to:

- Build eligibility screeners without extensive engineering support
- Configure eligibility logic using a guided interface
- Deploy screeners for public or internal use
- Provide users with clear, immediate eligibility results

BDT streamlines the process of translating policy rules into an interactive, user-friendly web experience.

## 2. What Is an Eligibility Screener?

An **eligibility screener** is a web-based form that:

1. Collects relevant information from a user
2. Evaluates that information against defined eligibility rules
3. Displays eligibility results based on the evaluation

Each screener consists of two primary components:

### User Interface (Frontend)

The user interface is the form that end users interact with. It:

- Collects required input data
- Guides users through the screening questions
- Displays eligibility results

### Eligibility Logic (Backend)

The eligibility logic defines how user inputs are evaluated. It:

- Applies benefit eligibility rules
- Processes responses
- Determines the final eligibility outcome

Together, these components allow organizations to convert benefit requirements into a structured, automated decision experience.
