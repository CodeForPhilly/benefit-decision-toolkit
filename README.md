**Scaffolding for modeling public benefits' eligibility logic with [Decision Model and Notation (DMN)](https://www.omg.org/dmn/).**

## Motivation

Why spend hours troubleshooting low-level logic that is barely related to the benefit rules you are trying to model?

Why build benefit models from scratch when there are so many concepts that are shared between them?

***DMN Benefit Toolbox simplifies benefit logic and makes managing executable rules easier for subject matter experts.***
