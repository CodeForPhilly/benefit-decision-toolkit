# DMN Benefit Toolbox

**Scaffolding for modeling public benefits' eligibility logic with [Decision Model and Notation (DMN)](https://www.omg.org/dmn/).**

## Motivation

Why spend hours troubleshooting low-level logic that is barely related to the benefit rules you are trying to model?

Why build benefit models from scratch when there are so many concepts that are shared between them?

***DMN Benefit Toolbox simplifies benefit logic and makes managing executable rules easier for subject matter experts.***

## Get Started

The easiest way to get started using DMN Benefit Toolbox is to open it in Project IDX:

<a href="https://idx.google.com/import?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fprestoncabe%2Fdmn-benefit-toolbox">
  <picture>
    <source
      media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
      srcset="https://cdn.idx.dev/btn/open_dark_32.svg">
    <source
      media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"
      srcset="https://cdn.idx.dev/btn/open_light_32.svg">
    <img
      height="32"
      alt="Open in IDX"
      src="https://cdn.idx.dev/btn/open_purple_32.svg">
  </picture>
</a>

[Project IDX](https://idx.dev/#introduction) is a web-based development environment created by Google. When you open DMN Benefit Toolbox in IDX, a development machine will be created and configured for you in the cloud.

(Of course, you can manually setup your laptop/desktop to work on DMN Benefit Toolbox locally, but it isn't recommended unless you really know what you're doing.)
