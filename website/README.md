# BDT Website

A website that presents BDT to stakeholders

## Technology

The BDT website is built with Astro, a JavaScript framework that functions as a static site generator. Content for the docs pages is written in Markdown. The site will be deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Editing the Site’s Content

Assets for the site including copy text and images can be contributed via the design document in Figma. Assets can be directly updated by editing the files in `src/assets`.
