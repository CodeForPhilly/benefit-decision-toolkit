## What We Do

Benefit Decision Toolkit is a project focused on making it easier for people to access benefits without confusion. At its core, the toolkit supports two key roles: Benefit Navigators, who speak directly with clients to understand their needs, and Benefit Analysts, who review and validate information to ensure the right support is delivered.

We envision a world where organizations and governments can streamline benefits access for people in need through collaborative, open-source software tools.
