## Our Mission

We are a team of problem solvers working to improve the usability and onboarding experience for creating benefit eligibility screeners, especially for non-technical users like benefits analysts.

There are so many eligibility screeners in existence, purpose-built, for a variety of specific use cases. There are high-level screeners and comprehensive screeners.  There are single-benefit screeners and multi-benefit screeners. There are screeners meant to be used directly by the person seeking benefits and others meant to be used by caseworkers.
