## History of BDT

There is a need in the non-profit community for easy-to-use and open source screener-building toolkits. Many small non-profits resort to building eligibility screening tools with Excel because this is the only low-cost and low-code option available to them.

There are so many eligibility screeners in existence, purpose-built, for a variety of specific use cases. There are high-level screeners and comprehensive screeners. There are single-benefit screeners and multi-benefit screeners. There are screeners meant to be used directly by the person seeking benefits and others meant to be used by caseworkers.
